## Abstract

Daosurance is a DAO based insurance company where all members are expected to participate at some level or other and enjoy the benefits of increased effeciency.  How this is achieved will be explored in the following sections but draws heavily on a "jury" system where participants are selected at random and expected to perform tasks that catch fraud and allow for improvements to be made to the organization in a decentralized way prolonging it's usefullness to it's members by it's own survival. 

If successfull it will outgrow traditional companies and will start to be somewhat of a borderless nation state that combines money and determines the best use of it's funds in ways that traditional charasmatic leader based governance is based.  While some of the ideas may be novel and flawed, it is important to start in order to make the improvements neccessary.

    But they are far less than the long-range risks and costs of comfortable inaction.”

## THE PROBLEM

Currently health insurance is approximately $300 a month for a single member.  $3,600 annually that for the currently health feels like a bottomless hole they are throwing money into that they won't be able to recoup or benefit from because all the profit is going towards a centralized corporation rather than the value created returning back to the members of it's network.

## FAQ

Q:  Will we ensure unhealthy people or those with pre-existing conditions?
A:  No, not at first.  We won't be able to afford those kinds of members at the onset.  We wish them well and are gratefull that we have existing insurance companies to treat them.  

A:  There is a maximum that one is able to pull out from the insurance that increases with time and money given to the platform.  The multiplier is quadratic.
